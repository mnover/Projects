# Car Database | C Programming

This project is a **car sales tracking system** built in C using **linked lists** and file handling. It was developed as part of a university coursework project to explore data structures, dynamic memory allocation, and user interaction in terminal-based applications.

## Features
- Add, remove, update, and list car entries
- Search cars by model, year, or price
- Save and load data from external .txt file
- Uses linked lists for dynamic memory management
- Includes basic input validation and error handling

## Tech Stack
- Language: C
- Data Structures: Linked Lists, Structs, Dynamic Memory
- File I/O: Read/write functionality for persistent storage
