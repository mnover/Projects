# Matthew Nover â€“ Project Portfolio
Welcome! I'm Matthew, an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Maryland. This repository contains a selection of my personal and academic coding projects.

## Repository Structure
Each folder follows the format:  
`<Project Name> | <Primary Language>`

Inside each, you'll find:
- Source code
- README with Workflow/ information, File structures, Implementation wishlists, and more
- Screenshots, documentation, output files, etc.

## Notable Work: Backwoods Development Game
The source code for the multiplayer game projects is private, but you can check out one of the games here:
