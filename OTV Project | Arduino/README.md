# ENES100 Over Terrain Vehicle

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the ENES100 Introduction to Engineering Design course in 2023. Our team was tasked to create an Over Terrain Vehicle (OTV) capable of navigating a randomized course and completing mechanical mission tasks — all autonomously, without external input after launch.

The OTV was built around an Arduino-compatible R3 board, four DC motors for drive control, a color sensor, a distance sensor, a motorized arm for physical interaction with mission elements, and a overhead eye that could tell position relative to the center of the board.
