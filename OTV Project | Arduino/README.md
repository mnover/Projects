# ENES100 Over Terrain Vehicle
This project was developed as part of the ENES100 Introduction to Engineering Design course in 2023. Our team was tasked to create an Over Terrain Vehicle (OTV) capable of navigating a randomized course and completing mechanical mission tasks autonomously. Our task was to detect dirt and plant a seed in it.


## Information
  - Written in Arduino (R3)
  - Autonomous navigation with obstacle detection and avoidance
  - Modular functions for movement, sensing, and task execution


## Devices Used
- Arduino R3 powered by rechargeable battery
- DC Motors
- TCS34725 Color Sensor and Analog Distance Sensor
- Motorized Arm
